# CompareImages
Test and compare image hashing implementations for comparing images

Note that this code is licensed using GPL 3.0 because one or more or the libraries I want to test are licensed that way.
This produces a command line program for comparing images, so you could call this program from your program without linking
any code ...  But it's intended only as a toy test program anyway.
